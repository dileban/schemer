** S-Expression

A symbolic expression, or S-expression, sexpr, sexp for short, in the
Lisp family of languages represents either an atom or a list. 

+ Atoms are immutable objects and represent a number or a symbol.
+ Lists represent data or code, and are modifiable (depending on the
  dialect).


** Cons Cells

+ Lists are expressed as /cons cells/ in the form =(sexp-1 . sexp-2)=.
+ Cons cells are ordered pairs and thus S-expressions represent binary
  trees.
+ Cons cells such as =(a . (b . (c . (d . NIL))))= can be written in a
  more simpler form as (a b c d)
+ NIL or () is a symbol for termination.
